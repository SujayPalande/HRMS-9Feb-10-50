You are working on an existing HRMS Expense Claims module.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT remove or modify existing Expense Claims UI, table, or actions.
- Do NOT break current approval functionality.
- ONLY ADD an approval workflow layer on top of existing logic.

================================================
GOAL
================================================
Add a rule-based multi-level approval flow for expense claims
based on predefined criteria such as claim amount.

================================================
1️⃣ APPROVAL FLOW RULES
================================================

Introduce approval levels based on expense amount:

Example rules:
- If amount ≤ ₹10,000
  → Approval required: Reporting Manager only

- If amount > ₹10,000 and ≤ ₹25,000
  → Approval required:
     1. Reporting Manager
     2. Manager’s Senior / Department Head

- If amount > ₹25,000
  → Approval required:
     1. Reporting Manager
     2. Department Head
     3. Finance / Admin

These rules must be configurable in code (easy to adjust later).

================================================
2️⃣ DATA MODEL (NON-DESTRUCTIVE)
================================================

Extend expense claim data with:
- approvalLevel (number)
- currentApprovalStep (number)
- approvalStatus per level (Pending / Approved / Rejected)
- approvedBy (role or user)

Do NOT alter existing fields.

================================================
3️⃣ APPROVAL ACTION BEHAVIOR
================================================

When "Approve" is clicked:
- If more approvals are required:
  → Move claim to next approval level
  → Status remains "Pending"
- If final level approved:
  → Status becomes "Approved"

When "Reject" is clicked:
- Immediately mark claim as "Rejected"
- Stop further approvals

================================================
4️⃣ ROLE-BASED VISIBILITY
================================================

Approval buttons should appear ONLY if:
- Logged-in user matches the current approval role
  (Manager / Senior Manager / Finance)

Other users can only view status.

================================================
5️⃣ UI ENHANCEMENT (MINIMAL)
================================================

Add a small "Approval Flow" indicator:
- Example:
  Manager ✔ → Senior Manager ⏳ → Finance ⏳

This can be:
- Tooltip
- Inline text
- Small step indicator

Do NOT redesign the table.

================================================
6️⃣ SECURITY RULES
================================================

- Users cannot approve their own expense
- Backend must validate approval authority
- Approval order must not be bypassed

================================================
EXPECTED RESULT
================================================

- Existing Expense Claims page remains unchanged
- Approval automatically routes to next authority based on amount
- Status updates correctly at each stage
- Enterprise-grade approval flow is achieved
