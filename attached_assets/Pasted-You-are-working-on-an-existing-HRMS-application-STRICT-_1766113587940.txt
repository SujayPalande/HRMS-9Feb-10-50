You are working on an existing HRMS application.

STRICT RULE:
- Do NOT modify, remove, or refactor any existing feature, layout, data, or logic.
- ONLY ADD a new Courses section.
- Everything else must remain exactly as it is.

================================================
GOAL
================================================
Add a "Recommended Training Courses" section inside
the Training & Development area.

This section is meant for:
- New Employees (basic onboarding knowledge)
- HR users (HR fundamentals & compliance awareness)

================================================
1️⃣ COURSE CARDS SECTION
================================================

Add a new section BELOW existing content named:
"Recommended Training Courses"

Display courses as responsive cards.

Each card must show:
- Course title
- Category (Employee / HR)
- Short description
- Source platform (Udemy / YouTube / OpenLearn / Coursera etc.)
- "View Course" button or clickable card

================================================
2️⃣ COURSE CATEGORIES
================================================

Create two groups of cards:

A) Employee Essentials
- Company Workplace Ethics
- Communication Skills
- Time Management Basics
- Introduction to Corporate Culture
- Cybersecurity Awareness for Employees

B) HR Essentials
- HR Fundamentals
- Employee Onboarding Process
- Payroll & Attendance Basics
- POSH Awareness
- HR Compliance Basics (India)

================================================
3️⃣ REDIRECTION BEHAVIOR
================================================

When a card or button is clicked:
- Open the course in a NEW TAB
- Redirect to a FREE or OPEN learning resource such as:
  - YouTube
  - Udemy (free courses only)
  - Coursera free modules
  - OpenLearn
  - Great Learning free courses

Use real, publicly accessible URLs.

================================================
4️⃣ TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
================================================

- This section is READ-ONLY
- No database changes required
- Courses can be stored as a static list / config array
- Do NOT connect this to approvals or requests

================================================
5️⃣ UI CONSTRAINTS
================================================

- Match existing design style (cards, spacing, fonts)
- Do NOT change sidebar, navbar, or existing sections
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

================================================
EXPECTED RESULT
================================================

- Existing Training Requests section remains unchanged
- A new Courses section appears below it
- Cards are clickable and redirect correctly
- No existing functionality is affected
